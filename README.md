# Aircharger
It's going to take the particles or the microwaves out of the air collect them like a screen like sifting the Wi-Fi waves or the Bluetooth connection and collecting power it's a wireless charger
think of long journeys in a Tesla car instead of stopping at charging ports focusing satellite pointing like laser beams at a solar panel you know or even passing by on the highway say towers cell phone towers or Wi-Fi towers as you pass by the friction you know or like magnetized you know the magnetic field from the car and the the tower that creates  power. a kind of power you know as ac / dc, like the magnit circling the inside of an electric motor it would be like the magnet on the car every time it passes by a pole/post, along the highways there would be posts all along the side of the road and then you know every 20 ft you know or however far apart. we would have to do the math calculations and get it exact  it would go: one two three four five, then a post one two three four five , then a posts .now doing that for a mile at 60 miles an hour could you imagine that would be creating power in its own collecting that and making it safe for the passenger too ..it's groundbreaking!! I think we start on a low scale with it with like remote control cars and we try to get our cell phones to air charged. air power, micro power.I was going to get a  snazzier name for it ,blue-fi charger. a wi-Blu-ray charge or blue charger or a fi- blue-wi charge so no more wires you know going wireless completely whenever we took the wire off of the remote control car along time ago that was really cool cuz then it gave us room to grow and took off the leash now imagine your robotic helper AI robot it's going to need to charge it's going to have to stop and go into its little closet and charge what if ,every movement, on every joint of the robot and the elbow,its shoulder ,it's knee that's where too collecting power so we need to think of how to collect smaller amounts power,learn how to use power like  AC to DC current probably rethinking everything and starting all over again I think we should with everything actually everything this is just the beginning get rid of all the guesses and all the lies and all the ending to everything let's no longer build things to die build things to last forever the first lie the biggest one ,the saddest the most heartbreaking lie told? we were born to die ? that brought a tear to my eye. anything that has a beginning don't have to have an end . what about you who's with me on reprogramming the world as we know It ? let's set the power free no one has even realized that we have harnessed all this power imprisoned it behind lock and key, lets take the leashes off, no more chan's. freedom begans when we go cordless.. 
reprogramming, redirecting, reclassify, restart as many time's bas it takes. be hold to keys tk the future lits actually make something worth living for so if and when we are ready to die we can have something worth dying for. its up to you , whos with me?
